title: Migrate tech notes
---

Evernote is great. I kept tech notes in Evernote from 10 years ago. That include learning notes, literature reviews, and tech tips. The notes marked my transition from a fresh bachelor in biology to a bioinformatician, and machine learning / data science player. Within this blog I'm going to migrate some recent notes and most importantly synchronize future notes.

There were a lot of "I hope I'd known it before" moments in learning. I hope the notes could be helpful not just for me.
