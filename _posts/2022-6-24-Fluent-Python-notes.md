title: "Book notes: Fluent Python, 2nd edition"
---

It's been a long time since I last updates the blog. A lot of things have happened. Time to carry on.

Start taking notes from halfway in chapter 2. Notes will be in a loose format.

## Chapter 2. An Array of Sequences.

* Match / case in python3.10
  * Consider use this new feature in some record / json parsing task. 
* `typing.TypeAlias`
  * Should give it a try. More typing setting helps to clear thoughts.
* `array.array`
  * Only used array in `numpy` before. 
* `hash()` to define if an object is immutable.
* `collections.deque`
  *  A use case: evenly allocating elements from groups of variable sizes
